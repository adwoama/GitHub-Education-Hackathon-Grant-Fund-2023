## Impact of GitHub Grant
We used the funds from the GitHub Education grant to get food and help pay towards our security for the event.
It was impactful because we had over twice as many attendees this year as we did last year, so we needed a lot more
food to make sure everyone got what they needed. It was also important that we paid for event security since we were 
hosting students overnight at the school and safety is important.
